# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files for the debugging game:

- `correct.mp3` - Plays when the answer is correct
- `wrong.mp3` - Plays when the answer is incorrect

## Where to Get Sound Files

You can download free sound effects from these sources:

1. **Freesound.org** - https://freesound.org
   - Search for "success sound" or "correct answer" for correct.mp3
   - Search for "error sound" or "wrong answer" for wrong.mp3

2. **Zapsplat** - https://www.zapsplat.com
   - Free sound effects after registration

4. **OpenGameArt.org** - https://opengameart.org

## Recommended Sound Types

- **correct.mp3**: A pleasant chime, success sound, or positive notification (duration: 0.5-1 second)
- **wrong.mp3**: An error beep, buzzer, or negative notification (duration: 0.5-1 second)

## File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Sample Rate: 44100 Hz (recommended)
- Bitrate: 128 kbps or higher
- Duration: 0.5-2 seconds (keep it short and snappy)
- Volume: Normalized (not too loud or too quiet)

## Note

The app will work fine without these files. If the sound files are missing, the game will continue to function normally - it just won't play sounds when answers are submitted.
