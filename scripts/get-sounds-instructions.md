# How to Get Sound Files

## Automated Download Failed

The automated download script cannot bypass the security restrictions on free sound websites. 

## Manual Download (Takes 2 minutes)

1. **Go to Mixkit** (easiest, no login):
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/

2. **Download Correct Sound:**
   - Search for "correct" or "success"
   - Click any sound → Click Download button
   - Rename to `correct.mp3`
   - Move to `assets/sounds/`

3. **Download Wrong Sound:**
   - Search for "error" or "wrong"
   - Click any sound → Click Download button  
   - Rename to `wrong.mp3`
   - Move to `assets/sounds/`

**That's it!** The app will automatically use them.

## The App Works Without Them

If you don't add the files, everything still works - just no sound effects. It's completely optional.
